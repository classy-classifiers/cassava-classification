# cassava-classification

The following repository stores the code and data for the midterm project for Data 2040 - Deep Learning and Special Topics in Data Science. The project is an image recognition task of Cassava leaf disease types for the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Kaggle competition. In the directory *Colab_Notebook* we store our Google colab notebooks which detail our model implementation and analysis scripts. The *data* directory includes the training data from Kaggle, as well as a singleton placeholder test image. The *images* directory includes figures we generated in the course of our EDA and model analysis.

Team members include: Chris Rohlicek, Jillian Green, and Cameron Webster
